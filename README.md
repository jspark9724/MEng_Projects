# MEng_Projects

Welcome to my project repository!

Here, you will find a collection of diverse projects and assignments I have completed during my time at the University of Toronto's Master of Engineering Program. This repository not only showcases my academic achievements but also includes my personal projects, reflecting my passion for coding and engineering beyond the classroom.

Feel free to explore the different projects, delve into the code, and see the challenges I've tackled and the solutions I've crafted. Each project comes with detailed documentation, explaining the purpose, technologies utilized, and the methodologies employed.

I hope my work inspires you and sparks your curiosity. Happy exploring, and thank you for visiting!
